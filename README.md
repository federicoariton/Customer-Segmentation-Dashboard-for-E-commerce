# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation for E-commerce

## 📘 Project Overview

This project applies clustering techniques to an e-commerce dataset to segment customers based on their behavior. Customer segmentation enables businesses to tailor marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and increase overall profitability.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Identify distinct customer segments using unsupervised learning (e.g., K-Means)
- Analyze purchase patterns and behavioral features
- Provide actionable insights based on customer clusters

---

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies

- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – data manipulation  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` – machine learning models  

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** Internal/Simulated e-commerce dataset  
- **Features:** May include Customer ID, Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value (RFM), geographic info, session time, etc.

---

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values and outliers  
- Feature engineering (e.g., RFM score calculation)

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution plots  
- Correlation analysis

### 3. Clustering
- Feature scaling  
- Determine optimal `k` using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score  
- Apply K-Means and/or Hierarchical Clustering

### 4. Cluster Profiling
- Visualize and interpret clusters  
- Provide business-oriented recommendations

## 📈 Results

The customer segmentation yielded four meaningful clusters:

- **At-Risk / Churned** – 1,590 customers  
- **Loyal Mid-Spenders** – 1,183 customers  
- **Recent Low Spenders** – 859 customers  
- **VIP Customers** – 701 customers

## Insights:

- A significant portion of customers are at risk of churning — ideal targets for re-engagement strategies.
- *VIP Customers* represent a smaller but highly valuable group — perfect for retention campaigns.
- *Loyal Mid-Spenders* are stable and could be nudged toward higher value through targeted offers.
