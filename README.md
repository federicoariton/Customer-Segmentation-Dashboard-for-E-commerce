# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation for E-commerce

## 📘 Project Overview

This project applies clustering techniques to an e-commerce dataset to segment customers based on their behavior. Customer segmentation enables businesses to tailor marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and increase overall profitability.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Identify distinct customer segments using unsupervised learning (e.g., K-Means)
- Analyze purchase patterns and behavioral features
- Provide actionable insights based on customer clusters

---

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies

- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – data manipulation  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` – machine learning models  

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** Internal/Simulated e-commerce dataset  
- **Features:** May include Customer ID, Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value (RFM), geographic info, session time, etc.

---

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values and outliers  
- Feature engineering (e.g., RFM score calculation)

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution plots  
- Correlation analysis

### 3. Clustering
- Feature scaling  
- Determine optimal `k` using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score  
- Apply K-Means and/or Hierarchical Clustering

### 4. Cluster Profiling
- Visualize and interpret clusters  
- Provide business-oriented recommendations

---

## 📈 Results

The notebook produces:

- Visual diagnostics of customer clusters  
- Behavioral summaries of each segment (e.g., high-value vs. low-value customers)  
- Marketing strategy suggestions tailored to each segment
